# Welcome to CLICKY!

Don't forget to bring an extra mouse with you!

Controls:

Left mouse button (of course)
Space (to start the game)
Escape (to go back to main menu)
In this game, you are going to catch as many creatures as you can, earn points and relax a little bit.

During this project, I have gained valuable knowledge and experience, which I'm going to mention below:

- Animating creatures: changing their scale when they are flying down or crossing the screen. They will disappear and be destroyed when clicked on.
- Object oriented coding: each creature has its own class and function. The main game and main menu screen also also have their own functionality and they work just as I want them to. Also, if you accidentally miss a creature and it goes of the scree, it will be destroyed to free up memory.
- Designing the main menu UI: setting up fonts, animating creatures down the screen and making the text flash to be more visible and hard to miss. I also continuously check if it needs to look better.
- Create a real-time scoring system: checking if the current score is higher than the previous highscore, and if so, setting it as the new highscore.

The game has executable files for Windows and Linux. You can also play it instantly on your browser without downloading any files. To do that, please check the window at the top of this page.
